### Intorduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">The **R-S-T system** is used by amateur radio operators, shortwave listeners, and other radio hobbyists to exchange information about the quality of a radio signal being received. The code is a three digit number, with one digit each for conveying an assessment of the signal's readability, strength, and tone.</p>


**Readability:**
<p style="text-align: justify;">The "R" in the R-S-T system denotes "Readability," which is a qualitative evaluation of the ease or difficulty in accurately interpreting transmitted information. In Morse code telegraphy transmissions, readability assesses the distinguishability of each character in the message text. In voice transmissions, it gauges the ease or difficulty in correctly understanding each spoken word. Readability is gauged on a scale ranging from 1 to 5.</p>

**Strength:**
<p style="text-align: justify;">The "S" in the R-S-T system represents "Strength," which evaluates the power of the received signal at the receiving location. While a precise signal strength meter can provide a quantitative measure, the Strength component in the RST code is typically a qualitative assessment. This assessment is often determined based on the S meter of the radio receiver at the signal reception location. The "Strength" is measured on a scale ranging from 1 to 9.</p>

**Tone:**
<p style="text-align: justify;">The "T" in the R-S-T system stands for "Tone" and is evaluated on a scale from 1 to 9. Tone considerations are applicable exclusively to Morse code and other digital transmission modes, making them irrelevant during voice operations. Advances in modern technology have significantly reduced imperfections in digital modulation by transmitters to the extent that they are rarely detectable by human ears.</p>
